#Temp Battle Interface

Sidebar should be able to be configurable to be displayed either on the left or right of the screen.
Interface should be designed such that it is playable with one hand, left or right, as well as in landscape or portrait mode.
(Tab like toggle for both enemy and friendly selection? Or just one toggle for both?)

Fleet near the bottom of the main display. Enemy always towards the top.
Fleet has multiple formations (formations need clarifications)
Context menu in sidebar depending on toggled selected unit.
