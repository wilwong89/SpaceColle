# RPG with two aspects:

- Logistical character management
- Turn-based strategy combat

Players obtain "ships" to form a small fleet squadron. Limit to max 6 ships per fleet to send into combat. A reserve roster is available to swap in and out.

# Logistical Aspect

Initial starting point is Kantai Collection style logistical management in terms of ships, leveling, and equipment.

# Combat Aspect

Initial starting point is Fate/Grand Order style combat, with less emphasis on the Buster-Arts-Quick combat roulette card selection.
More emphasis on base skills of the ship and skills granted by equipment.
