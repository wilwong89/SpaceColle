# Story Setting

The year is 300 SE (Space Era) set in an alternate universe with humans but shares no history with the real world.
Humanity here unified the homeworld and started expanding into the stars.
Extra-terrestial life exists, but only a few decide to become multi-planetary or establish empires.
Spaceborn civilizations do not fight over resources or colonization of planets, as technology and the vastness of space allows for building habitats space-based mining.
There are conflicts, however, over religion, species superiority, or simply alien thought viewpoints.

Dispersed around the galaxy are ancient pieces of technology, incredibly black-boxed and advanced. Most defy analysis and replication, but very slow progress is made reverse engineering. Very slow.
The species interested in expansion or exploration race to excavate the technologies before the rival.
Technologies range from simple directed energy weapons all the way to space elevators to planetary energy shields.
But the most common type of technology found space vessels. Space vessels that each contain an artificial intelligence to operate them.
The AIs are bound to the vessel and could operate them independently, but prefer to bond and take orders from a singular sapient.
