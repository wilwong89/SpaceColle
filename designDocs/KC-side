===KC-side, otherwise known as Admin Management===

Will be similiar to KC in terms of fleet and resource Management

-Resources
--Are fuel, ammo, and metals (No bauxite for now)
--Fuel and ammo for sortieing. Metal for repairs.
--No buckets or development materials
--Ships are asked to be resupplied on sortie. 
---When a player selects a map, the "sortie" button will subtract resouces on click
---They can only sortie on that map if they can resupply all sortieing ships fully

-Weapons
--Ships do not take ammo themselves. The individual weapons will have an ammo count
--For example, a railgun might have: 
{   
    Big Ass-Cannon: {
        attackType: "railgun", //railgun type is like FGO's buster type.
        attackDamage: "int",
        ammoUsed: "int",
        ammoPerCost: "int"
    }
}
--Fully resupplied weapon means ammoUsed is zero.
---Every time this weapon is used in battle, ammoUsed goes up by one
---Can only sortie if all fleet weapons ammoUsed = 0
---To reset ammoUsed to zero, player must play ammoUsed * ammoPerCost
