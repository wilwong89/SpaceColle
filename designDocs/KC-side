===KC-side, otherwise known as Admin Management===

Will be similiar to KC in terms of fleet and resource Management

-Resources
--Are fuel, ammo, and metals (No bauxite for now)
--Fuel and ammo for sortieing. Metal for repairs.
--No buckets or development materials
--Ships are asked to be resupplied on sortie. 
---When a player selects a map, the "sortie" button will subtract resouces on click
---They can only sortie on that map if they can resupply all sortieing ships fully
--Ships will have a hardcoded max value for ammo and fuel.
---Ex: Battleship (500 fuel, 500 ammo), Destroyer (100 fuel, 50 ammo)
---Each combat stage will draing 20% and 20% ammo. (Change ammo consumption to per shot later.)

-Weapons and equipment
--Will do nothing for now.
--Weapons, stats, and equipment are hard coded into ships
--Only functinality is the capability of equip/unequipping.
--Weapons and equipment actually affect stats to be implemented later

-Fleet Lineup
--Setup ship selection exactly like KC.
--First ship is secretary ship (But we'll call it flagship)
